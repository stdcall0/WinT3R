## 📖 Overview
We present WinT3R, a feed-forward model that infers precise camera pose and high-quality point map for image stream in an online manner. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

1. **We propose an online window mechanism,** enabling sufficient interaction of image tokens
within the same window and across adjacent windows.
2. **We maintain a camera token pool,** which functions as a lightweight ”global memory” and
improves the quality of camera pose prediction with a global perspective.
3. **We achieve state-of-the-art performance,** experiments demonstrate that WinT3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 3D reconstruction and camera pose estimation, with the fastest reconstruction speed to date.

## 🛠️ TODO List
- [x] Release point cloud and camera pose estimation code.
- [ ] Release evaluation code.
- [ ] Release training code.

## 🌍 Installation

```
conda create -n WinT3R python=3.10
conda activate WinT3R
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  # use the correct version of cuda for your system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 💿 Checkpoints
Download the checkpoint from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/lizizun/WinT3R/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin) and place it in the checkpoints/pytorch_model.bin directory.

## 🎯 Run Inference from Command Line


```bash
# Run with default example images
python recon.py

# Run on your own data
python recon.py --data_path <path/to/your/images_dir>
```
